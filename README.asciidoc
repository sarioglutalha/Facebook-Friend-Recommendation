# Facebook Friend Recommendation

The format of both files is the same: +
The first line of the file is an integer representing the number of users in the given network. +
other lines are the IDs of two users who are friends.

For example, here is a very small file that has 5 users in the social network: + 
5 +
0 1 +
1 2 +
1 4 +
2 3 

The above is a representation of a social network that contains 5 users. +
User ID=0 is friends with User IDs = 1 +
User ID=1 is friends with User IDs = 0, 2, 4 +
User ID=2 is friends with User IDs = 1, 3 +
User ID=3 is friends with User IDs = 2 +
User ID=4 is friends with User IDs = 1

big.txt has 1000 users.
small.txt has 10 users.

for small one, result: +
  The suggested friend for 0 is 9 +
  The suggested friend for 3 is 1
  
for big one, result: +
  The suggested friend for 88 is 213 +
  The suggested friend for 5 is 67
